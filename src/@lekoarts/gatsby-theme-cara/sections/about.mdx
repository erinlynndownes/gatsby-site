## What I've done

I began my career making games for ABCya, an educational site for children. I had the opportunity to grow with the startup, changing from Flash to HTML5, while creating more engaging activities with polished animations, optimized physics implementations, and responsive design. During my years there I worked with JavaScript, ActionScript, CreateJS, Phaser, ThreeJS, and the Adobe Suite.

More recently I have been making casual games for social platforms. My current tools are Typescript, PIXI, Redux, and Webpack. I've learned a lot about making larger scale, maintainable games, as well as CI/CD and project management, while working with companies like Zynga and Softgames.
